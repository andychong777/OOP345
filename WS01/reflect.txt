    The topics that I learned while completing this workshop was learning
the difference between internal and external linkage, using static variables, and
using std:: string related fucntions. In my code the variables extern double g_discount;
and extern double g_taxrate; have external linkage becuase they are declared as an extern
at global scope. They can be defined in one source file and accessed from another.
I also had internal linkage as well. For example, static const int NAME_LENGTH = 10;
has internal linkage because it is declared as a static const within the namespace
sdds. Static variables are useful in this workshop because I dont have to allocate
memory for each object. static const int NAME_LENGTH = 10; This is a static data member
of riderequest class and is shared among all objects in the class. Lastly the changes
I had to my RideRequest included using getline. In my code I used this function to
get the customer name and ride description. Problems that i had while coding was 
due to making the formatting correct.

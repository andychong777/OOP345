I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor
provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

It is nessesary to add the members that I added in the book class because I can
specify the conditions under which book object should be considered to be true or
false. To add on the < and > comparison operators are used for sorting the books.
By using these operators I basically provide a way for the program to understand
how book objects should behave in boolean contexts.
The getLargestItem and getSmallestItem cannot be querries becuase as they are static
they are associated with the class itself and not with specific instances of the class.
The static member functions can only access static member variables. Also if I made
them public it would break the principle of encapsulation.
I think the operator[] function can be considered a query function. It allows access
elements of the m_items array. It does not change anything in the collection class.
The reason we define the class objects outside the class definition is because it 
separates the declaration of the class structure from its use and memory allocation
allowing it to be a modular program. 
The specialization of smallest item and largest item for book and size 10 allows
initialization of the static variables.
Also the initialization of smallest item and largest objects for book and size 72
are necessary because it ensures that these static variables have specific initial
values tailored for the collection class with max of 72. It makes sure that the class
behaves correctly.

I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor
provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

    The significant time difference between copy and move operations is due to the
way they handle resources. Copy operations create a new copy of the object, which
involves allocating new memory and codying data, while move operations transfer the
ownership of the resources. The airport log constructor reads the input file line
by line and read it again to populate the array. To avoid rereading the file, the
size of the array can be dynamically changed as elements are added. Here is an example
from my code where i read the input file line by line. This part of the code that 
determines the size of the dynamic array and then reads the file again to populate it:
 m_airportArr = new Airport[m_size];
    for (size_t i = 0; i < m_size; i++)
        m_airportArr[i].read(fptr);
Lastly the difference between steady clock and system clock are in the stability.
steady clock represents a clock that will never be adjusted and system clock may be adjusted
for example day light savings. So steady clock should be used when precise time measurements
are required and system clock when real time applications are needed.
